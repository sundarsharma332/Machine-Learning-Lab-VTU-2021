Algorithm :

1. Initialize h to the most specific hypothesis in H
2. For each positive training instance x
    For each attribute constraint a, in h
        If the constraint a, is satisfied by x
        Then do nothing
        Else replace a, in h by the next more general constraint that is satisfied by x
3. Output hypothesis h
